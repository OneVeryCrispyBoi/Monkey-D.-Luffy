    <h2>His Past</h2>

At first, Luffy wanted to fight them but then he began to realise that pirates were able to do anything they wanted with no consequences whatsoever. He saw that the pirates were having an amazing time partying, eating, drinking, and singing. Luffy had realized how much freedom the pirates had and then he had made his mind. He was going to become the king of the pirates and become the person with the most freedom in the world.</p>

    <h2>The World of One Piece</h2>
    <p>The world is dived into 4 powers;Pirates, the navy, the revolution, and the world government. The world government sits at the top of the world's power. many people do not dare to defy the world government but pirates could care less. The navy serves under the world government. The navy protects everyday citizens of the world from corrupt people and pirates. Pirates plunder and loot other pirates they rebel against the navy and do whatever they feel like doing. Pirates like having the freedom to do whatever they want. The revolution works from the shadows and the oppose the world government directly. They plan to take down the world government which holds most of the power of the world amnd create a new and just world.</p>
